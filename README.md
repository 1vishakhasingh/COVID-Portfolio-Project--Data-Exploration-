# COVID Portfolio Project Data Exploration

**With the help of this project we  will able to get following things:-**

1. Deathpercentage by calculating (CONVERT(float, total_deaths) / NULLIF(CONVERT(float, total_cases), 0)) * 100.
2. Casepercentage by calculating (NULLIF(CONVERT(float, total_cases) /(CONVERT(float,population)), 0)) * 100.
3. location from where high  number of cases came was 'WORLD'.
4. Showing countries with highest death count per population.
5. Countries with highest infection  rate compared to population---(Cyprus)
6. GLOBAL NUMBERS.
7. Total population vs vaccinations by joing both the tables covid_death table & covid_vaccinated.
